# Typescript Types to describe Audio Trip custom choreography files

All information in here is either from https://bit.ly/3kkHEbW,
taken from discussions in the Audio Trip Discord
or gleaned from inspection of saved choreographies.

(Not published on npm, for now.)

## Use

```
npm add https://github.com/hn3000/ats-types
```

```
import * as ATS from '@hn3000/ats-types';
```

(I think.)
